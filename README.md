This project was developed using NextJS and Chakra-UI. The option for Chakra was made with the objective of studying the development of functional frontends, without the need to use custom CSS, using everything that the framework can offer.

As a backend, an API was developed (is in development) using Ruby on Rails that supports the data consumed by the Frontend.

# Technologies

- [JSON-Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server):  Since the initial objective was to learn how to use Chakra, JSON-Server was used to provide a fake API environment to display the desired contents. In future steps, the API with Ruby on Rails will be developed, which will replace the JSON-Server, however, this development format allows the Front-end to act independently of the back-end.
